# Data & Information Quality Project: Commercial Businesses in Milan

**Course:** Data and Information Quality – Politecnico di Milano (A.Y. 2025/2026)

### 🎯 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is the transformation of a "dirty" administrative dataset provided by the Municipality of Milan into a **solid, reliable, and ready-to-use database**. The project aims to demonstrate how a rigorous Data Quality pipeline can turn raw data into a valuable tool for decision-making processes.

### 🛠️ The Pipeline

To achieve this goal, a comprehensive *Data Preparation* pipeline was implemented, structured across 5 main phases:

*  **Data Profiling:** An initial data exploration was performed to map distributions, identify outliers and locate missing values and structural inconsistencies.
*  **Data Quality Assessment (Initial and Final):** The trustworthiness of the raw dataset was formally measured using standard metrics (e.g., completeness, accuracy). This measurement was repeated at the end of the pipeline to certify the achieved improvements.
*  **Data Cleaning & Entity Resolution:** Apply appropriate techniques to clean data and enhance its quality.
*  **Data Wrangling:** Columns were restructured, useful information was merged, resulting in the final clean dataset 

### 💻 Technologies Used

Tech stack:

*  **Python 3.12:** The core language of the entire project.
*  **Google Colab:** The chosen development environment to ensure reproducibility and computational power.
*  **Pandas & NumPy:** For intensive DataFrame manipulation and mathematical operations.
*  **RegEx & Unicodedata:** Fundamental tools applied to "tame" and standardize the chaotic texts in the original dataset.
*  **Scikit-learn:** Used to implement and evaluate the final Machine Learning model.

### 🏆 Achieved Results

The final result is a dataset successfully cured of its original anomalies. The levels of *Completeness* and *Accuracy* of critical fields have drastically increased, providing a solid and reliable foundation for any future analysis regarding the commercial fabric of the city of Milan.
